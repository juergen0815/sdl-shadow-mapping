Draw one pass into depth buffer

Use depth to set "bright" light value

Render fully light scene


- Idea: Use a "Ray caster" to render shadow pass. Don't run all this through the main renderer. Maybe
        create some render targets. A light pass target, a shadow pass target, etc.
        
The problem: 
    It should be possible to render shadows/reflection transparently through a given scene graph
    Nodes can request interest in a certain render pass, but some specific setup for each pass might
    require a dedicated renderer for each pass. Shadow casting can be done in a dynamic and static way,
    a static light map only needs to be calculated once for static objects and light sources and can 
    be "baked" into the scene, while a dynamic shadow map must be rendered each frame.

    It would be nice to render the shadow map in parallel with the main render loop. We don't necessarily 
    need to update shadows every frame or it doesn't need to be done in sync to the render loop.
